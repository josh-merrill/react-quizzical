## My process

My goal for this project was to develop a small quiz web application using React. Throughout the development process, I followed these steps:

- **Design**: To create the website's design, I utilized Figma. You can find the design file [here](josh-merrill.com).
- **Code Editor**: For writing and editing the code, I relied on VSCode.
- **Version Control**: To manage the project's source code and track changes efficiently, I used Git and GitHub, which simplified my version control operations.
- **Frontend Framework**: As the foundation of this web application, I utilized React, which allowed me to build a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Deployment**: For deploying the web application, I chose Vite, a build tool that ensures fast and optimized development and production builds.


## How did I build it?

I built this application using HTML/CSS and React JS with Vite as the development tool. I first set up a new React project using Vite and created the main components, including Form, Quiz, Answer, and Loader. Throughout the development process, I leveraged React Hooks like useState and useEffect to efficiently manage state and handle side effects. By integrating the Open Trivia Database API, I was able to fetch quiz data based on user settings, making the app dynamic and adaptable. Additionally, I introduced user interactivity by allowing users to select answers and receive real-time feedback. After completion, the app calculates and displays the quiz results, providing users with their scores.


## What problem did I set out to fix?

The primary aim of this project was to build an engaging quiz app that provides users with an enjoyable experience while challenging their knowledge in various categories. By creating a simple and interactive web application, I aimed to offer an entertaining way for users to test their trivia knowledge.


## What were some of the design decisions?

During the development process, I made the following design decisions:

- **User-friendly Interface:** I focused on creating a clean and intuitive user interface to ensure users could easily navigate and interact with the quiz.
- **Customizability:** The app allows users to customize their quiz by selecting the number of questions, category, difficulty, and question type, giving them more control over their quiz experience.
  

## What I learned

During the development of Quizzical, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in several areas:

- **React Fundamentals:** I solidified my understanding of React components, state management using hooks, and conditional rendering.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** I learned how to fetch data from an external API and handle asynchronous operations effectively.
- **CSS Styling:** The project allowed me to practice CSS styling and responsive design to create an appealing and user-friendly layout.
- **Debugging and Troubleshooting:** Throughout the development process, I encountered and resolved various issues, honing my debugging skills.


## What I would change if I had more time

Given more time, there are a few improvements and additional features I would like to implement:

- **User Authentication:** Introducing user authentication would enable users to save and review their quiz results.
- **Leaderboard:** Implementing a leaderboard system to showcase high scores and achievements among users.
- **Animations and Transitions:** Adding animations and transitions to enhance the overall user experience.
